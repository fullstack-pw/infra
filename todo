* fix makefile to remove plan after applying
* build remote images to harbor to not loose like bitnami event
* support k3s via cluster-api
* support k0s via cluster-api

* install OpenStack Sunbeam (also known as MicroStack) on node02
* create pipeline and playbook to CRUD proxmox vm templates to cluster-api using image builder
* centralize and move all pipelines to specific repo
* migrate teleport, observability and sandboxy to cluster-api
* minimize runners images
* enable pod to pod encryption
* prevent pods escalation
* replace privileged DinD sidecar with a rootless alternative (Kaniko or buildah). The current docker:dind with privileged: true bypasses all AppArmor/seccomp protections and is the single biggest remaining security gap in the runner setup
* rootless k3s on tools
